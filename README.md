# Transponder
Personal Transponder using Arduino ATtiny85


Instead of us!ing a remote to unlock your house, car, or other things, just carry this with you and it will all happen automatically.

Because it is a low power device, it will activate the receiver units only when you are very close to them.  This means they will lock as soon as you walk away.

Just set this unit asside when at home.  It is motion activated and will automatically shut down when it is not moving.

Of course this is only half of the project.  The receiver units are now in the works.
